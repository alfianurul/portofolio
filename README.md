# Personal Portofolios

Some portofolios I made, mostly on data science and data analysis. Almost all data related projects are using python, but 1 (cyclistic) is using R. 

## Data Science
1. [Human Resource - Predicting Who Will Left the Company](https://github.com/alfianurul/ML_HR-Attrition)
   Predicting who will left the company using available data. Comparing logistic regression, random forrest, and artificial neural network using Tensoflow for classification.
   
2. [Image Recognition - Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/alfianurul/ML_Rock-Paper-Scissor)
   Artificial neural network model using TensorFlow to recognize image of hand in the form of rock, paper, and scissors.
   

## Data Analysis
1. [Cyclistic - How Member differs from the Casuals? - Analysis in R](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anrakhma/cyclistic-in-r/notebook)
   Marketing analyst team need to find out how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic's bikes differently.
